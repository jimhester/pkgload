#' Load complete package.
#'
#' `load_all` loads a package. It roughly simulates what happens
#' when a package is installed and loaded with [library()].
#'
#' Currently `load_all`:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Loads all data files in `data/`.  See [load_data()]
#'     for more details.
#'
#'   \item Sources all R files in the R directory, storing results in
#'     environment that behaves like a regular package namespace. See
#'     below and [load_code()] for more details.
#'
#'   \item Compiles any C, C++, or Fortran code in the `src/` directory
#'     and connects the generated DLL into R. See [compile_dll()]
#'     for more details.
#'
#'   \item Runs `.onAttach()`, `.onLoad()` and `.onUnload()`
#'     functions at the correct times.
#'
#'   \item If you use \pkg{testthat}, will load all test helpers so
#'     you can access them interactively. Devtools sets the
#'     \code{DEVTOOLS_LOAD} environment variable to \code{"true"} to
#'     let you check whether the helpers are run during package loading.
#'
#' }
#'
#' @section Namespaces:
#' The namespace environment `<namespace:pkgname>`, is a child of
#' the imports environment, which has the name attribute
#' `imports:pkgname`. It is in turn is a child of
#' `<namespace:base>`, which is a child of the global environment.
#' (There is also a copy of the base namespace that is a child of the empty
#' environment.)
#'
#' The package environment `<package:pkgname>` is an ancestor of the
#' global environment. Normally when loading a package, the objects
#' listed as exports in the NAMESPACE file are copied from the namespace
#' to the package environment. However, `load_all` by default will
#' copy all objects (not just the ones listed as exports) to the package
#' environment. This is useful during development because it makes all
#' objects easy to access.
#'
#' To export only the objects listed as exports, use
#' `export_all=FALSE`. This more closely simulates behavior when
#' loading an installed package with [library()], and can be
#' useful for checking for missing exports.
#'
#' @section Shim files:
#' `load_all` also inserts shim functions into the imports environment
#' of the laded package. It presently adds a replacement version of
#' `system.file` which returns different paths from
#' `base::system.file`. This is needed because installed and uninstalled
#' package sources have different directory structures. Note that this is not
#' a perfect replacement for `base::system.file`.
#'
#' @param path Path to a package, or within a package.
#' @param reset clear package environment and reset file cache before loading
#'   any pieces of the package. This is equivalent to running
#'   [unload()] and is the default. Use `reset = FALSE` may be
#'   faster for large code bases, but is a significantly less accurate
#'   approximation.
#' @param recompile force a recompile of DLL from source code, if present.
#'   This is equivalent to running [pkgbuild::clean_dll()] before
#'   `load_all`
#' @param export_all If `TRUE` (the default), export all objects.
#'   If `FALSE`, export only the objects that are listed as exports
#'   in the NAMESPACE file.
#' @param export_imports If `TRUE` (the default), export all objects that are
#'   imported by the package. If `FALSE` export only objects defined in the
#'   package.
#' @param helpers if \code{TRUE} loads \pkg{testthat} test helpers.
#' @param quiet if `TRUE` suppresses output from this function.
#' @param recollate if `TRUE`, run [roxygen2::update_collate()] before loading.
